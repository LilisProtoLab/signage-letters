# Lili's Proto Lab signage letters
The lab shop front is decorated with brightly illuminated letters inspired by diverse topics from engineering/science/prototyping. Each letter is handmade by a member of the team and serves as a right-of passage.

## Main features
L - the first letter of our name, the letter that started it all. Lennart built this with our Shaper Origin router.
P - Jacob created this puzzle-inspired letter. 3D printed from transparent PLA it lights up like no other.
O - Central in our shop front, Nico created a O-shaped digital analogue clock using Neopixels.
T - Integrating old circuitry, epoxy casting and acrylic processing, Josh built an ever color-shifting T.
L - Inspired by Nature, Pieter created this amalgamation from a tree, laser-cut acrylic and RGB lights.
