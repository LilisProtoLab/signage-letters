LED illuminated "P" letter

Jacob Seifert
In this project, I will describe the tools to realize the P character in the LPL logo. The initial idea was to 3D print puzzle pieces that form the letter "P" (at 60 cm height) with background LED illumination.


Tools:
- Inkscape (open source software)
- Fusion360 and TinkerCAD (freeware from Autodesk)
- 3D printers
- glue
- LED strip (bought from here)

Design files: published here (Zip file, 2.1 MiB)

Step 1: Use Inkscape to draw the puzzle pieces as vector graphics (SVG)
Step 2: Use Fusion360 and Autodesk to transform the SVG into STL files.
	• Import SVG to Fusion360. Extend the surface to 25 mm in height. Use the shell command with 3 mm thickness. lower the base plate by 2 mm to achieve a front surface thickness of 1 mm (as this was tested to look nice with background LEDs)
	• Export STLs to TinkerCAD. There, add the "Letter Mount" object (see Zip file in the Feed section of this project) to at least three puzzle pieces to mount later to a wooden board. Also, I've added cutouts to the puzzle shells to route the LED strips through later. 
Step 3: 3D print those puzzle pieces (also included in the Zip file)

Step 4: Glue the LED strips into the puzzle pieces. Done.
