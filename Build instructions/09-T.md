# Recycled Electronics Stained Glass "T" 
*Joshua Hauser*

A lighting sculpture inspired by stained glass, made from embedded recycled electronics in epoxy tiles. The piece is shaped like a large letter ‚ÄúT‚Äù and features continuously shifting RGB lighting controlled by a Seeeduino Xiao.

## üß∞ Supplies

- PMMA/acrylic sheets (Perspex)
- Transparent PLA filament
- Two-part epoxy resin
- Old electronics (circuit boards and components)
- RGB LED strips
- Seeeduino Xiao (microcontroller)
- Wire, solder, and power supply for LED strips
- DMF (dimethylformamide) or other suitable acrylic solvent

## üèó Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Circuit Board Pieces

- Salvage old electronics and remove tall components (desolder or cut them off).
- Cut the circuit boards into small fragments. A steel corner cutter for sheet metal works well for this.

### 2. Make Epoxy Tiles

- In Fusion 360 (or other modeling software), model a hexagonal tile with 50 mm side lengths.
- 3D print the tile as a vacuform blank.
- Use the blank in a vacuum former to create negative molds.
- Arrange PCB fragments inside the molds.
- Mix and pour two-part epoxy resin into the molds and let cure.

### 3. Build the T-Shaped Structure

- Design a "T" shape in Inkscape and generate SVG files for laser cutting.
- Laser cut two main panels:
  - **Back panel**: a solid ‚ÄúT‚Äù shape.
  - **Top panel**: a T-shaped honeycomb pattern to hold the tiles.
- Use Fusion 360 (or inkscape or other software) to generate the 2D honeycomb pattern for the top panel.
- Cut edge strips for the sides using a table saw.
- Sandblast all acrylic parts to create a frosted glass effect.
- Assemble the box with DMF solvent:
  - Glue the frosted side strips between the top and bottom panels.
  - For each tile: epoxy-glue it to its matching laser-cut blank (from the top panel), then glue the blank to the bottom panel.

### 4. Install Electronics

- Design two LED zones:
  - **Interior zone**: fills the gaps inside the T.
  - **Outer border zone**: wraps around the perimeter.
- Solder RGB LED strips into two separate circuits.
- Program the Seeeduino Xiao to run randomized brightness and color changes across both circuits.
- Power the system with a suitable voltage source (match your LED strip specs).

### 5. Final Assembly

- 3D print transparent PLA clips to secure the top panel in place without permanent bonding.
- 3D print standoffs with screw slots for mounting or hanging the sculpture.
- Clip the top on and mount the finished piece.
